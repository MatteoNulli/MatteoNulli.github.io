## Motivation

Most Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) use contrastively pre-trained vision encoders.  
They work well on many tasks, but often struggle when it comes to **compositional understanding** and **reasoning** about what‚Äôs actually in an image.  
That‚Äôs because these encoders are mainly trained for image‚Äìcaption retrieval, not for truly breaking down and understanding all parts of a scene.  

Another issue is efficiency: state-of-the-art vision encoders generate **2‚Äì3x more visual tokens**, which slows down both training and inference.  

To tackle these problems, we introduce **OG-LLaVA (Object-Guided [LLaVA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03744))**.  
With our new connector design, **`OG-Fusion`**, the model can reason about visual content more effectively‚Äîwithout adding lots of extra tokens or fine-tuning the vision encoder itself.  

At the core of `OG-Fusion` is a simple but powerful idea: combine **CLIP representations** with **segmentation masks**.  
This lets OG-LLaVA leverage the descriptive strength of segmentation models to better capture **object relationships** and **spatial arrangements**.  

The result?  
**OG-LLaVA outperforms existing comparable models on tasks that demand deeper visual reasoning and grounding**, all while staying efficient.

</div>


We extract visual features from the input image through a Vision Encoder.  
Concurrently, we pass the input image through `OG-Fusion`. Here we:  
1. Use a Segmentation model to retrieve the masks,  
2. Downsample the segmentations, and  
3. Apply these masks onto the visual features.  
4. Concatenated together and passed through a Multi-Layer Perceptron to produce Object-Guided Visual Tokens (**_OGVT_**).  

The **_OGVT_** are then given as input to a Large Language Model together with Textual Tokens to produce an output.  
The ‚ùÑÔ∏è (snowflake) and üî• (fire) represent modules whose parameters are kept **frozen** or **turned on**.  
LoRA emphasizes that not all parameters of the LLM are unfrozen, only the LoRA layers.

## Visualizations

The images we picked cover all kinds of tricky challenges‚Äîspotting tiny details, telling apart subtle colors, reading depth cues, recognizing materials, making sense of spatial layouts, and even detecting small objects. They‚Äôre designed to push visual‚Äìlanguage reasoning to its limits. What‚Äôs key is that these examples are tested at inference time with no extra fine-tuning, so any boost (or drop) in performance comes purely from the Object-Guided priors built into **OG-LLaVA**.

In [Figure&nbsp;4](#fig-conme-rel-2), [&nbsp;5](#fig-conme-obj) and [&nbsp;6](#fig-conme-rel-1) we highlight a range of cases where **OG-LLaVA** consistently demonstrates sharper perception and more grounded reasoning, from subtle posture cues to tricky color judgments and material recognition.  

- **Fine-grained human pose**: correctly reads a batter‚Äôs stance, placing the bat *up and behind* instead of *in front*. ([Figure&nbsp;4 - Picture1](#fig-conme-rel-2))  
- **Precise color & reflection reasoning**: rules out red in umbrellas, confining it to apples/plate, while the baseline gets misled, as well as captures realistic color reflections on materials and disambiguates different hues. ([Figure&nbsp;4 - Picture2](#fig-conme-rel-2)), ([Figure&nbsp;5 - Picture8](#fig-conme-obj)) & ([Figure&nbsp;6 - Picture2](#fig-conme-rel-1))  
- **Depth-of-field understanding**: detects focus fading *front-to-back* instead of mistakenly *left-to-right*. ([Figure&nbsp;4 - Picture3](#fig-conme-rel-2))    
- **Material recognition**: identifies a skate-park surface as *concrete*, not asphalt and glass instead of curtains. ([Figure&nbsp;4 - Picture4](#fig-conme-rel-2)) & ([Figure&nbsp;5 - Picture1](#fig-conme-rel-2))  
- **Font recognition**: picks up subtle font characteristics, showing solid OCR ability. ([Figure&nbsp;5 - Picture2](#fig-conme-obj))  
- **Spatial reasoning**: accurately locates people and objects in complex scenes. ([Figure&nbsp;5 - Picture3](#fig-conme-obj)) & ([Figure&nbsp;5 - Picture6](#fig-conme-obj))  
- **Object counting & detection**: counts giraffes correctly where the baseline stumbles and spots a distant coffee maker amid clutter, avoiding confusion with a blender. ([Figure&nbsp;5 - Picture4](#fig-conme-obj)) & ([Figure&nbsp;6 - Picture3](#fig-conme-rel-1))  
- **Fashion understanding**: distinguishes between short sleeves and cap sleeves. ([Figure&nbsp;5 - Picture7](#fig-conme-obj))    
- **Dynamic cues**: understands a distant sail is *inflated with strong breeze*, matching the surfing context. ([Figure&nbsp;6 - Picture1](#fig-conme-rel-1)) 
- **Shape recognition**: correctly identifies train tracks in the background. ([Figure&nbsp;6 - Picture4](#fig-conme-rel-1)) 

Together, these examples underline how **OG-LLaVA** moves beyond surface-level cues. It pays attention to fine details, adapts across diverse tasks, and reasons about entire scenes in a way that more closely reflects human understanding.

## Results

Our results on compositional reasoning and vision-centric benchmarks [Table&nbsp;1](#tab-main-res), show that **OG-LLaVA** consistently outperforms its baselines, across both *[LLaVA-1.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03744)* and *[Cambrian-1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16860)* training setups. The improvements are not marginal‚Äîthey‚Äôre large and systematic.  

- **Compositional understanding**  
  - **ARO**: 
    - +21% on *Coco-Order* (38.2 ‚Üí 82.6) and +16% on *Flickr-Order* (49.1 ‚Üí 84.0). 
    - *Visual Genome Attribution* on average +10% across backbones and on *Visual Genome Relation* +20% across training data and model sizes.  
  - **ConME**: steady +2% gains, peaking at 65.2 in the 8B setting (+3.6 over the strongest baseline).  

- **Vision-centric reasoning**  
  - **MMVP**: about +3 points on average (e.g. 32.0 ‚Üí 37.0 in 8B, 61.6 ‚Üí 66.0 with *Cambrian-1* data).  
  - **CVBench**: stable performance, with only ¬±1 point fluctuations.

A recent study on *[Subobject-level Image Tokenization (SIT)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14327)* introduced a way of using segmentation masks to create more efficient visual tokenization for multimodal models. While the focus of that work lies in segmentation and tokenization, one of their experiments overlaps directly with our domain, making for an interesting comparison.  

In [Figure&nbsp;7](#fig-sit-vs-ours), we compare **OG-LLaVA-8B**, SIT-8B, and LLaVA-1.5-8B under the same backbone. The results are clear: **OG-LLaVA** consistently outperforms SIT, with more than a 25% advantage on compositional reasoning and a 10% edge in visual grounding.  

There‚Äôs also a key difference in usability. **OG-LLaVA** works flexibly both with and without segmentation masks at inference, while SIT requires pre-computed masks every time. This not only adds non-trivial overhead‚Äîsince a separate segmentation model must run first‚Äîbut also makes the system less adaptable. In practice, the reduced token count doesn‚Äôt outweigh the complexity introduced, whereas **OG-LLaVA** preserves efficiency without imposing such constraints.
