📌 Hi, this is Matteo, an Applied Researcher at eBay with the Foundation Models Team. My work at eBay, focuses on reaserch in multimodal learning, inference optimisation and multimodal search reasoning with [Hadi Hashemi](https://www.seyyedhadihashemi.com/) and [Shahram Khadivi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khadivi/).

🔙 Previously, I graduated cum-laude [ELLIS Honours](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/news-/recognizing-young-ai-talent-excellence-11-ellis-msc-honours-students-graduated-cum-laude-under-joint-supervision-of-ellis-members-across-europe/#:~:text=(6)%20Matteo%20Nulli,rigorous%20and%20rewarding.) from the MSc in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html) at the University of Amsterdam. For my master thesis, I was lucky to be suprevised by [Yuki Asano](https://yukimasano.github.io/) at [FunAI Lab](https://fundamentalailab.github.io/), [Ivona Najdenkoska](https://ivonajdenkoska.github.io/) and [Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani](https://mmderakhshani.github.io/) to investigate Compositional Reasoning in Multimodal Foundation Models. Concurrently I spent time at eBay as Research Intern, supervised by [Cees Snoek](https://www.ceessnoek.info/), working with [Hadi Hashemi](https://www.seyyedhadihashemi.com/) and [Vladimir Orshulevich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-orshulevich-289a7a170/). Before that, I graduated from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en) with a BSc in [Mathematical and Computing Sciences for AI](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence/) and was an exchange student in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au) with a full-ride scholarship. 

💭 My research interes lies in the intersection between Language and Vision. I am particularly interested in linking multiple modalities together. Recently I studied visual representation learning and how to leverage it for extensive image-understanding in MLLMs.
