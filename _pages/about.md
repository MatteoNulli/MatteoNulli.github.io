<!-- ðŸ“Œ Hi, this is Matteo, a MSc student in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html) at the University of Amsterdam and a Applied Scientist Working Student in Multmodality at eBay. Previously, I graduated from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en) with Bachelor's of Science in [Mathematical and Computing Sciences for AI](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence/). During this time, I was selected to participate in an exchange program at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au) with a full scholarship, taking courses in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.    -->

ðŸ“Œ Hi, this is Matteo, a MSc student in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html) at the University of Amsterdam and a Applied Research Intern in Multmodality at eBay. Previously, I graduated from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en) with a BSc in [Mathematical and Computing Sciences for AI](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence/) and was an exchange student at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au) with a full scholarship, taking courses in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.   

ðŸ’­ My research interest is in Multimodal LLMs. Particulary, I am looking at visual-representation learning and how to leverage it for extensive image-understanding in Multimodal models. 

ðŸ“š Currently focusing on compositional understanding for my thesis and working on Multimodal Learning. 

Always open to hear about possible research collaborations, feel free to reach out.
