ðŸ“Œ Hi, this is Matteo, a first year MSc student in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html) at the University of Amsterdam. Previously, I attended Bocconi University where I attended a Bachelor's of Science in [Mathematical and Computing Sciences for AI](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence/). During this time, I was selected to participate in an exchange program at at the University of Sydney where took courses in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.   

ðŸ’­ My research interests lie in bridging the gap between Vision and Language within AI systems. Multimodal models are capable of merging two of the most important aspects of how us humans learn and interact with the world around us. I strive to align the performance of Multimodal foundation models to that of LLMs. 

<!-- I am also interested in Reinforcement Learning applied to robotics.  -->

ðŸ“š Currently I am taking the [Foundation Models](https://uvafomo.github.io) and [Deep Learning 2](https://uvadl2c.github.io) courses.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
