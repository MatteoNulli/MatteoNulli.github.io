Fortunate to visit Prof. [Yuki Asano](https://www.novatalent.com/111/italy/student-list/2025)
at [FunAI Lab in UTN Nuremberg](https://fundamentalailab.github.io/) as part of [ELLIS Honours program](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/people/) for my master thesis on Compositional Reasoning in Vision-Language.
