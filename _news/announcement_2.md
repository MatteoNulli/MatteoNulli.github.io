During my bachelor's I was selected to join the University of Sydney for a full semester, taking [Deep Learning](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/COMP5329), [Stochastic Processes](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/STAT3921) and [Big Data and Data Diversity](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/DATA2901) courses. I also loved surfing there 🏄
